  Sandbox build executor for Sealos deploys: build a container image from
  source with an in-cluster Kaniko Job and push it to GHCR, for environments
  without a Docker daemon (Brain managed Devbox sandboxes). Use only when a
  managed deploy (SEALAI_DEPLOY_MODE=managed) needs an image built from
  project source; local interactive deploys build with docker buildx instead
  (see the use-sealos skill).

# K8s Kaniko Job

Builds `linux/amd64` images inside the Kubernetes namespace when no Docker
daemon exists. One script owns the whole flow — do not hand-roll Jobs or
Secrets around it:

```bash
python3 scripts/kaniko-build.py --image ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:<tag> \
  [--context <dir>] [--dockerfile <path-relative-to-context>] \
  [--build-arg KEY=value ...]
```

Resolve `scripts/` against this skill's directory. Run the script from the
project workspace so it finds `.sealos/build-runtime.json`.

## How it works

```text
tar the context (excludes .git/.sealos/.versitygw-*)
  → DevBox-local VersityGW S3 store (POSIX dir, served on port 1319)
  → Kaniko Job in the current namespace pulls s3://... via the
    Job-reachable endpoint from .sealos/build-runtime.json
  → pushes the tagged image to ghcr.io with a build-only registry Secret
  → digest captured from the pod termination message
```

Everything is resolved automatically, in order: CLI flags →
`.sealos/build-runtime.json` (written by the control plane: Job-reachable
`s3Endpoint`, S3 `secretKeyRef`, build deadline) → DevBox runtime env
(`KANIKO_CONTEXT_POSIX_DIR`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `SEALOS_DEVBOX_JWT_SECRET`, ...) →
defaults. The Job runs with `backoffLimit: 0`, an active deadline capped at
1800s, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600`, and the current ServiceAccount.

## Preconditions

- `kubectl` pointed at the sandbox namespace (injected kubeconfig; the script
  never selects a region, workspace, or other namespace).
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the `write:packages` scope. The target image owner must
  equal the token's login, lowercased: `ghcr.io/<login>/<repo>:<tag>`. Tag
  with the commit SHA or a timestamp, never `latest`.
- Namespace permissions to create Jobs/Secrets and read Pods/logs.
- A Dockerfile inside the context (write one first if missing — rules in
  `../use-sealos/references/build.md` §1; the buildx/registry sections of
  that file do not apply here).

## Reading the result

On success stdout is JSON with `digest` and `image_ref`
(`ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>@sha256:...`). Prefer `image_ref` in deployment
manifests — the digest pin survives tag mutation. If `digest` is null (rare:
termination message lost), fall back to the tag reference in `image`.

`pull` reports downstream pull behavior:

- `anonymous` — the package is public; no pull secret needed.
- `private` — GHCR packages are private by default. Create a pull secret in
  the namespace and reference it from the workload
  (`imagePullSecrets: [{name: <app>-pull}]`, fixed literal name):

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret docker-registry <app>-pull \
    --docker-server=ghcr.io --docker-username=<login> \
    --docker-password="$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

- `indeterminate` — verify by watching the first pod pull, and add the pull
  secret if it hits `ErrImagePull`.

## Failure triage

The script prints Job status, pod state, and the Kaniko log tail on failure.

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| Job pod `ImagePullBackOff` on the executor image | cluster cannot pull `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor` → report; there is no local fallback |
| Kaniko log: `error uploading context` / S3 connection refused | the Job cannot reach the VersityGW endpoint → check `.sealos/build-runtime.json.s3Endpoint`; never point the Job at 127.0.0.1 |
| Kaniko log: `401/403` on push | token scope or owner mismatch → the script's preflight output shows the authenticated login |
| Dockerfile build error | fix the Dockerfile in the workspace and rerun; each run creates a fresh Job |
| Job deadline exceeded | build too slow → trim the context (`.dockerignore`), use smaller base images |

Build-only Secrets (`use-sealos-ghcr-auth-*`) are namespace-local with no TTL;
the Job itself is garbage-collected after an hour. Leave cleanup to sandbox
teardown unless the user asks.

Never print `GITHUB_TOKEN`, S3 credentials, or Secret payloads. Never pass
secrets through `--build-arg` — build args are visible in the Job spec.
