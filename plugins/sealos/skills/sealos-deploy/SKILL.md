  Brain managed-mode deploy executor for Sealos Cloud. Use when
  SEALAI_DEPLOY_MODE=managed (a Brain Devbox sandbox) or when the task says to
  run /sealos-deploy: deploy the workspace repository to Sealos through the
  MCP-gated managed pipeline — classify, build via Kaniko if needed, generate
  the canonical template, hand off through template_ready /
  deployment_completed, and verify. Outside managed mode, use the use-sealos
  skill instead.

# Sealos Deploy (Brain Managed Mode)

Executor half of a two-party contract: this agent analyzes, builds, deploys,
verifies, and repairs inside the sandbox; Brain (the control plane) renders
input forms and gates completion through exactly two MCP tools. Deploy
mechanics come from the sibling `use-sealos` skill (`../use-sealos/`, relative
to this skill's directory); this file owns only the managed-mode differences.

## Mode gate

Run this flow only when `SEALAI_DEPLOY_MODE` is exactly `managed`; otherwise
follow [../use-sealos/SKILL.md](../use-sealos/SKILL.md) and ignore the rest
of this file. In managed mode, before any other work, confirm the MCP tools
`template_ready` and `deployment_completed` are available; if either is
missing, stop with a fatal error — never substitute a file, webhook, or text
answer for a missing control tool.

## Environment

Brain injects (read these; never enumerate the whole environment):

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE` | project root, `/home/devbox/project` |
| `SEALAI_NAMESPACE` | target namespace (also `SEALAI_DEPLOY_NAMESPACE`) |
| `KUBECONFIG` | `/var/run/sealos/kubeconfig/config` — in-cluster shape: `server: https://kubernetes.default.svc`, CA and token as file refs under `/var/run/sealos/kube-api-access/`, namespace set in the context. `kubectl` uses it as-is; `sealos-api.py` inlines the CA/token into a self-contained kubeconfig for Template API calls automatically (never written to disk or printed) |
| `SEALOS_REGION` | region URL, e.g. `https://usw-1.sealos.io`. Required in managed mode: the in-cluster server cannot reveal the region. If `sealos-api.py status` shows `region_domain: null`, it is missing — fail with a clear error, never guess. `SEALAI_TEMPLATE_API_URL` (full Template API base URL) is an optional override |
| `SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH` | fixed user-input file, exists only after the user submits the form |
| `SEALAI_DEPLOY_LABELS_PATH` | `/run/sealai/deployment/labels.json` — platform ownership labels as a JSON object; forwarded verbatim, see Deploy |
| `SEALAI_DEPLOY_LABELS_JSON` | legacy fallback for the same labels (the platform strips its quotes, so it is not valid JSON; the script tolerates that) |
| `SEALAI_TURN_DEADLINE_AT` | the only hard time limit |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | source builds and private-image pull secrets |

Hard rules (they override the use-sealos execution rules where they differ):

1. Never run `sealos-api.py login`, OAuth, or `switch`. The injected
   kubeconfig is the only credential; `sealos-api.py` and `wait-app.sh` read
   `KUBECONFIG` and `SEALOS_REGION` automatically.
2. Fully non-interactive: never ask the user anything — values only the user
   knows are declared as template `inputs` and collected by Brain's form.
   Mutations inside the namespace, including a delete strictly required for
   convergence, are pre-authorized; never pause for confirmation.
3. Never print or log `SEALAI_DEPLOY_MCP_TOKEN`, kubeconfig contents, or any
   value from `SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH`.
4. No file-based RPC: never create `control.json`, `inputs-required.json`,
   `turn-report.json`, `verify-report.json`, or anything under `.sealos/brain/`.
5. After deploying, do not end the turn until Brain has returned
   `accepted_stop` (or `template_ready` returned `awaiting_user`); a turn
   that ends without a control call is a contract violation.

## Pipeline

### 1. Classify

Classify with the use-sealos decision tree ([deploy.md](../use-sealos/references/deploy.md),
[recipes.md](../use-sealos/references/recipes.md)): known self-hosted product
→ store template or official image; user source code → Kaniko build. Skip
that skill's preflight/login part entirely.

### 2. Build (source path only)

No Docker daemon exists here. Read [../k8s-kaniko-job/SKILL.md](../k8s-kaniko-job/SKILL.md)
first, then run the sibling executor from `$SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE` (path
relative to this skill):

```bash
python3 ../k8s-kaniko-job/scripts/kaniko-build.py \
  --image "ghcr.io/<token-login>/<repo>:deploy-<git-short-sha>"
```

Use the returned digest-pinned `image_ref` in the template. If `pull` is
`private`, create the `<app>-pull` secret now (command in that SKILL.md) and
reference it from the workload with the fixed literal name.

### 3. Template at the fixed path

The canonical artifact is exactly `$SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE/.sealos/template/index.yaml`.
Brain reads this path byte-for-byte — no other location counts.

- **Store hit**: materialize the store template locally, then continue on the
  raw-deploy path (the store-instance endpoint is forbidden in managed mode:
  it cannot carry the ownership labels and leaves nothing to hash):
  ```bash
  python3 ../use-sealos/scripts/sealos-api.py store-export <template> \
    --out "$SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE/.sealos/template/index.yaml"
  ```

- **Official image / built image**: write the template per
  [platform.md](../use-sealos/references/platform.md) (plus
  [databases.md](../use-sealos/references/databases.md) for KubeBlocks blocks).

Managed-mode requirements on top of the platform contract:

- Start with the `apiVersion: app.sealos.io/v1` / `kind: Template` header, a
  non-empty `metadata.name`, and resource documents after the first `---` —
  Brain rejects the handshake otherwise.
- Declare every value only the end user can supply (external API keys, admin
  email, ...) in `spec.inputs` with `required: true` and no default; Brain
  renders its form from exactly these. Everything else belongs in
  `spec.defaults` (`${{ random(8) }}` suffixes stay — the Template API, not
  Brain, evaluates them at deploy time).
- Never add labels beyond the platform contract; the ownership labels travel
  through the deploy call, not the YAML.

### 4. Handshake: template_ready

Run `sha256sum "$SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE/.sealos/template/index.yaml"` and
call `template_ready` with only `{"sha256": "<lowercase hex>"}` — the hash of
the final file bytes. Editing the file after hashing fails the handshake with
`template_digest_mismatch`; rehash and call again.

- **`awaiting_user`** → stop the turn immediately: no Template API call, no
  `kubectl apply`, nothing. Brain collects the form and resumes this same
  thread with values in `SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH`. After resuming, do not change
  `spec.inputs` (Brain rejects the new schema); rerun `template_ready` with
  the unchanged file, then continue.
- **`continue`** → deploy the same file.
- Tool error → diagnose, fix, retry the same call. Control errors are
  recoverable; missing tools are fatal.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
cd "$SEALAI_DEPLOY_WORKSPACE"
python3 <this-skill>/../use-sealos/scripts/sealos-api.py deploy \
  .sealos/template/index.yaml \
  $(test -f "$SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH" && echo --args-file "$SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH")
```

- User values flow only through `--args-file "$SEALAI_INPUTS_PATH"` — never
  into prompt text, logs, or tool arguments.
- The script forwards the ownership labels (from `SEALAI_DEPLOY_LABELS_PATH`,
  falling back to `SEALAI_DEPLOY_LABELS_JSON`) to the Template API as
  `extraLabels` automatically. Never edit, extend, or re-derive those labels,
  and never invent `deployment-name`/`template-name` labels. The Instance
  name comes from the deploy response (`response.name`); Brain supplies none.
- Do **not** call `sealos-api.py adopt` (or POST `adopt-template-instance`):
  managed deploys already stamp `brain.io/*` via extraLabels and a second
  claim returns 409. The script skips adoption when `SEALAI_DEPLOY_TASK_ID`
  or `SEALAI_PROJECT_ID` is set, and when the region is not `*.sealos.io`.
- Quota or validation errors: fix the template (re-run step 4 — the hash
  changed) or report via the normal repair loop. Never shrink resources silently.

### 6. Verify, then deployment_completed

Verify for real before reporting ([deploy.md](../use-sealos/references/deploy.md)
§Verify; triage failures with [operate.md](../use-sealos/references/operate.md)):

```bash
HOST=$(kubectl get ingress -l "cloud.sealos.io/deploy-on-sealos=<instance>" \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.rules[0].host}')
bash ../use-sealos/scripts/wait-app.sh -t 600 ${HOST:+-u "https://$HOST"} \
  -l "cloud.sealos.io/deploy-on-sealos=<instance>"
```

Only after your own checks pass, collect the real references:

```bash
kubectl get deployments,statefulsets -l "cloud.sealos.io/deploy-on-sealos=<instance>" \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.apiVersion}{" "}{.kind}{" "}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Call `deployment_completed` with:

- `workloads`: 1–32 refs, each exactly
  `{apiVersion, kind, name, namespace: $SEALAI_NAMESPACE}` — no extra fields
  (the schema is strict). At least one must be a **ready Deployment,
  StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, or Pod**; reporting only Instance/App/Cluster
  objects fails verification. Add KubeBlocks Clusters as extra refs when the
  app has databases.
- `publicUrl` (optional): the `https://<host>` the app serves, only when an
  Ingress exists and your own probe returned 2xx. Brain re-probes it from
  outside and requires the tenant domain; if its findings say the URL is off
  that domain or unreachable while the workloads are healthy, call again
  without `publicUrl`.

Responses and errors:

- `accepted_stop` → done; end the turn with a normal summary.
- `repair` → the findings are evidence, not commands. Diagnose, fix **in
  place** (`kubectl` patch/apply/rollout on the existing resources; rebuild
  via step 2 if needed), re-verify, call `deployment_completed` again. Never
  create a second Instance, rerun the Template API to "start fresh",
  re-evaluate `random()` identity defaults, or ask for new input values.
  There is no repair-count limit; the only limit is `SEALAI_TURN_DEADLINE_AT`.
- `deployment_completed_throttled` → wait ≥5s, call again.
- `deployment_completed_before_template_ready` → run step 4 first.
